    "In the realm of Sanctoria, nestled deep within the misty forests and craggy mountains, lies the legendary dungeon of The Lost King. It is said to be filled with untold riches, ancient relics, and formidable monsters guarding its treasures. As the wise and benevolent ruler of Sanctoria, King Hexter has decided to assemble a daring raiding party to plunder the depths of the dungeon and reclaim its treasures for the kingdom.\n",

    "As the illustrious ruler of Sanctoria, King Hexter is faced with the daunting task of assembling a formidable dungeon raiding party. The success of the raid hinges upon the careful selection and allocation of resources to hire Fighters, Rangers, and Clerics for the expedition into the depths of the Lost King’s home.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the planning of this dungeon raid, the King’s advisors have provided him with the following: Gold: The kingdom's treasury can afford to spend no more than 18000 gold coins on hiring adventurers. Each Fighter costs 1000 gold coins, each Ranger costs 600 gold coins, and each Cleric costs 750 gold coins. Lumber: The construction of necessary equipment for each troop requires ample quality lumber. The kingdom has 12000 units of lumber available for the raid. Each Fighter requires 500 units, each Ranger requires 750 units, and each Cleric requires 300 units. Food: The raid will last several weeks so food must be kept and stored during the raid. The raid will be able to carry 1500 units of food available for the raid. Each Fighter requires 50 units, each Ranger requires 45 units, and each Cleric requires 75 units. Power: The power of the raiding party will dictate the level of the raid’s success. Each Fighter gives 10 points, each Ranger gives 12 points, each Cleric gives 16 points.\n",
    "\n",
    "The King’s military advisors have also discussed strategies that will be employed in the raid: Having more Fighters than Rangers will bolster the raiding party's frontline defense To avoid casualties, each Cleric must have at most 3 Fighters that they are supporting"
